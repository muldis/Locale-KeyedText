---------------------------------------------------------------------------

20xx-xx-xx

    * Locale::KeyedText version 2.1.2 for Perl is released on CPAN as
    Locale-KeyedText-2.1.2.tar.gz.

    * Make the distro pass the Perl Kwalitee "has_abstract_in_pod" test:
    For every pod file, tweak its NAME section so the abstract
    is on the same line as the package name rather than the next line.

    * TODO: meta_yml_has_provides

2019-10-20

    * Locale::KeyedText version 2.1.1 for Perl is released on CPAN as
    Locale-KeyedText-2.1.1.tar.gz.

    * Between the prior release and this one, the programming language
    formerly known as "Perl 6" was renamed to "Raku".  As such, all
    documentation that refers to that language was updated to use its new
    name, and all language that referred to "Perl 5" now simply refers to
    "Perl" because "Perl" now unambiguously means Perl 5.  The only
    exception to these changes is in documentation about history, such as
    all prior entries in this Changes file.

    * Lowered the declared minimum Perl version dependency to 5.8.0 (2002)
    from 5.8.1 (2003) since the prior .1 requirement seemed rather
    arbitrary and all 5.8.z and newer should suffice.

    * The declared minimum version dependencies for some Perl-bundled
    modules were lowered to those shipped with 5.8.0 from those with 5.8.1:
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker is now 6.03 from 6.17,
    "overload" is now 1.00 from 1.01.

    * As long as your Perl is version 5.8.1 (2003) or newer, each of the
    Locale::KeyedText classes requires only the Perl core and core modules
    to run, and nothing else, so usage is trivially easy. If your Perl is
    instead version 5.8.0 (2002), you need only also install the 1
    dual-life CPAN module Scalar::Util version 1.13+; 1.09 is the actual
    minimum dependency, but 1.13 matches what was bundled with Perl 5.8.1.

    * Locale::KeyedText is now released under the terms of the Artistic
    License version 2 rather than the GNU Lesser General Public License
    (LGPL) version 3+.

    * Updated all documentation to use an updated canonical Muldis Data
    Systems url of https://muldis.com rather than several http:// variants.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2019.

2016-08-06

    * Locale::KeyedText version 2.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Locale-KeyedText-2.1.0.tar.gz.

    * The sole change of this release is to rearrange the lib/* files at a
    high level, mainly by splitting those files apart into smaller files.

    * Added new file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pod which contains all the POD
    documentation that was in KeyedText.pm and en.pm.  As such, all of the
    lib/*.pm files now only contain Perl code, and all POD now lives in
    lib/*.pod files.  The first primary benefit of this change is that the
    code and documentation can more easily be organized differently where
    we want, rather than their needing a 1:1 structural correspondance.
    The second primary benefit of this change is that now all POD will be
    automatically HTMLized by GitHub or other repositories for easier
    reading, rather than POD inside *.pm files not getting that treatment.

    * Split the file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm into itself plus 2 new files
    lib/Locale/KeyedText/Message.pm and lib/Locale/KeyedText/Translator.pm.
    The end result is that this distribution no longer has any primary
    packages that are "cuckoo packages", meaning packages declared in a
    file with a different name than the package.  While such bundling can
    be a reasonable design choice, the CPAN infrastructure does run into
    some problems where those exist.  For example, one can ask a CPAN
    client to "install" such a package which it will then do but then treat
    as if it hadn't.  Therefore, in the future, "cuckoo packages" should be
    restricted more to ones that are truly internal and not part of a
    public API of the module; Message and Translator ARE part of the API.

    * This release has no other changes, and in particular no functional
    changes.  However, its version is being incremented by 0.1.0 rather
    than 0.0.1 because it breaks forwards compatibility; one can now "use"
    Message or Translator directly, and previously they couldn't.

2016-08-05

    * Locale::KeyedText version 2.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Locale-KeyedText-2.0.0.tar.gz.

    * This is the first release of Locale::KeyedText after a full decade
    with no development, and it has a new major version largely due to the
    module having gotten a number of large incompatible changes since the
    early 1.x releases (particularly in release 1.06_3).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 2.0.0 and en.pm 2.0.0.

    * The first main purpose of this release is to excise all of
    Locale::KeyedText's runtime dependencies on non-Perl-core modules, so
    that it can be installed and used with a relative minimum of overhead.
    As of this release, each of the 2 Locale::KeyedText classes requires
    only the Perl core or core modules to run, and nothing else.  For the
    test suite that is also the case, at least if that Perl is version
    5.10.1 or newer; otherwise, the test suite also depends on just the 1
    dual-life CPAN module Test::More version 0.92 or newer.  This release
    is also about bringing other aspects of modernity to this distribution.

    * Note that despite the significant internal refactoring or
    reimplementation of Locale::KeyedText, release 2.0.0 should be entirely
    backwards-compatible; any code written for release 1.72.0+, or even
    1.70.0+, should work with it unchanged.

    * This distribution has excised its direct external dependencies on the
    modules Class::Std, Class::Std::Utils, Readonly, "only" and "version".
    The dependencies on those were mostly added with release 1.06_3 per
    recommendation of the book "Perl Best Practices" but in retrospect
    those particular changes didn't really bring much to the table.

    * Now that KeyedText.pm no longer uses Class::Std, its 2 classes now
    explicitly define their own new() submethods, and also the style for
    declaring and using object attributes is now akin to what Moose
    provides, but that it is implemented manually.  Besides new(), each
    class now has an explicit BUILDARGS() method plus an explicit private
    accessor method per attribute for all other class methods to use.  Also
    each object is once again a regular Perl blessed hashref, as it last
    was in release 1.060002, not the "inside-out" style of Class::Std.

    * For use by BUILDARGS(), en.pm has gained an additional user text
    message with key 'LKT_ARGS_BAD_PSEUDO_NAMED'.

    * Reverted a stricture added to the Translator constructor submethod by
    release 1.06_3; now, once again, if a given argument is not an array
    ref, the argument will be treated as if it were an array ref having a
    single element which is that given argument.

    * Added new direct external dependency on the Perl core module
    "overload" in order that as_debug_string() automatically be used when a
    Message or Translator object is used in a string context; previously
    those methods had a STRINGIFY trait implemented by Class::Std.
    We explicitly require the version 1.01 that is bundled with Perl 5.8.1.

    * Add new Message|Template methods as_debug_str() which are like
    as_debug_string() but returns a terser representation that is not split
    over multiple lines and adds fewer labels.  The output of the new
    methods should match that of the as_string() methods last seen in
    release 1.060002, unlike the as_debug_string() methods added in 1.06_4.

    * Fixed Locale::KeyedText::Translator->template_module_is_loaded() to
    replace the line "return defined %{$module_name . '::'};" with
    "return scalar keys %{$module_name . '::'};" since calling "defined" on
    a Perl hash gives a deprecation warning on newer Perls and otherwise is
    bad practice and the replacement does the desired job more reliably.

    * Modernize the POD formatting of the API documentation in
    KeyedText.pm.  Each class or stand-in now has its own level-1 heading.
    Each routine now has its own level-2 heading so it is easy to lookup,
    and the routines are now grouped under level-1 headings by category.
    Each routine's documented signature now specifies submethod vs method,
    names each method invocant as $self, adds routine parameter types, adds
    routine result types where applicable.  Proper names such as classes
    are now C<> quoted.  Also moved a detail block from the VERSION section
    to INTERFACE.

    * Removed the Perl shebang line "#!perl" from every Perl file with one.

    * The second main purpose of this release is bringing back the thorough
    (such as it was) test suite that came with Locale::KeyedText up through
    release 1.060002 and was entirely purged with release 1.06_3.  Any
    changes made to the test suite for the current release relative to how
    it was in release 1.060002 are detailed in separate bullet points next.

    * Increased the direct external dependency on Test::More to version
    0.92, which is the version bundled with Perl 5.10.1; updated the test
    suite to use done_testing(), that v0.88+ has, rather than plan().

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_3:  Add new test suite
    wrapper functions t_LKT_Util->new_[message|translator](), that wrap
    Locale::KeyedText::[Message|Translator]->new(), and have the rest of
    the test suite invoke those wrappers rather than the now nonexistant
    Locale::KeyedText->new_[message|translator]() wrappers.  Also the new
    wrappers pass all inputs to said constructor submethods as named
    arguments, the newly only acceptable means, rather than as positional
    ones which they continue to take themselves.

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_3: The as_string() methods
    last seen in release 1.060002 are now named as_debug_str() in 2.0.0.

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_3:  Renamed all the
    accessor methods to be more terse, as follows: get_message_key() ->
    get_msg_key(), get_message_variable[|s]() -> get_msg_var[|s](),
    get_template_[set|member]_names() -> get_[set|member]_names().

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_3:  Empty strings are no
    longer considered valid for use as a Message Key, names of Message
    Variables, and elements of Set Names and Member Names; using such would
    throw an exception rather than succeed.  And so, case by case, any
    tests giving empty string inputs have been altered to either expect
    failure on those same inputs, or the inputs have been changed to
    non-empty strings when the test wasn't specifically about an empty
    string input and a success had been expected.

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_3:  All constructors and
    methods now throw exceptions on bad input, rather than returning undef.
    And so, the test suite now tests that a routine call dies to pass a bad
    input test rather than checking that it returns undef.

    * Updated the test suite to account for the following breaking changes
    introduced in Locale::KeyedText version 1.06_4:  Changed how Text
    Templates work such that variable names to be interpolated must now
    appear inside "<>" instead of "{}".

    * Locale::KeyedText is now licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License (LGPL) version 3 or later, rather than version
    2.1+ of the same license.  The text of the updated license is now in
    the 2 files LICENSE/LGPL and LICENSE/GPL rather than 1 file "LGPL".

    * The LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT now names Muldis Data Systems as the owner
    rather than Darren Duncan; in practice there is no difference however.

    * Update AUTHOR emails from perl@ to darren@.

    * Rewrote most of the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to make its format
    more modern, in particular by distinguishing between dependencies that
    are needed to use the Locale::KeyedText module and those needed only
    for testing it or for configuring the distribution; previously, the
    dependencies needed only for testing were treated as if necessary to
    use Locale::KeyedText itself; also added a list of "resources" urls.

    * Modernize the headings of the distribution files {Changes, README,
    TODO} and tweak the INSTALL file.  Modernize the content of the README
    file on Locale::KeyedText version control or other resources are.

    * Remove superfluous generic code comments.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2016 (from 2006).

    * Fleshed out this distribution's "Changes" file to restore all of the
    detail entries that earlier releases contained and subsequent releases
    had purged.  And so as of the current release 2.0.0 the "Changes" file
    should have a complete accounting of the project history, the only
    thing being more thorough than that being the project version control.

    * This is the Locale-KeyedText-2.0.0 file manifest:

2006-05-01

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.73.0/1.073000 (SVN r1261).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.73.0 and en.pm 1.0.1.

    * Updated external dependency on Class::Std to v0.0.8 from v0.0.4.

    * In the Makefile.PL only, specified that the minimum required
    'version' version is v0.57.

    * Added a warning to Makefile.PL so that it requests users would ignore
    test failures of the depended-on 'only' module.  Also removed the
    warning about preferring the latest Perl 5.8.x version.

    * Changed the prerequisites list in Makefile.PL so that all minimum
    versions are specified as floating point numbers, and none as strings;
    as a result, the prerequisites check by MakeMaker should work correctly
    with installed modules that satisfy the requirements but don't match
    the specific versions mentioned.

    * In KeyedText.pm, added a export_as_hash() method for each class, so
    that there is a uniform way to either clone the objects or prepare them
    for freezing such as with a serialization module, if one wanted to do
    that; the thawed results can be fed directly as new() arguments.

    * Minor fix to each MyApp.pl in examples/; changed a "+@foo == 0" to
    "@foo == 0" in each; the actual behaviour didn't change, though.

    * In KeyedText.pm and en.pm both, minor SEE ALSO update.

2006-02-01

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.72.1/1.072001 (SVN r1203).

    * This release is concurrently available in both Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions.  The Perl 5 version is in the same distribution as this
    Changes file.  The Perl 6 version is bundled with Pugs-6.2.11 (released
    on 2006-02-01), in its ext/Locale-KeyedText/ subdirectory.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.72.1; unchanged code file
    versions are: en.pm 1.0.0.

    * In KeyedText.pm, updated the INTERFACE pod section to replaced many
    occurances of 'argument' with 'parameter', which is the more
    technically correct term in those situations.  Also corrected the SEE
    ALSO pod, since the SQL::Routine namespace no longer exists.

    * In the README file, rewrote the second paragraph of KEEPING UP TO
    DATE so that it is more accurate and up to date; there is no longer a
    Rosetta-Incubator pseudo distribution in my Subversion repositories.

    * Minor Makefile.PL update to cite Perl 5.8.8 rather than 5.8.7 as the
    newest existing version.

    * Synchronized common headings for these files: Changes, README, TODO.

    * There were no other changes of any kind.

2006-01-02

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.72.0/1.072000 (SVN r1162).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.72.0.

    * Added new module Locale::KeyedText::L::en, version 1.0.0, in
    preparation for Locale::KeyedText to throw its own exceptions as
    Message objects.  Updated t/LKT_00_Compile.t and MANIFEST accordingly.

    * In KeyedText.pm, replaced all 10 occurances of the literal empty
    string ('') with the already-defined constant $EMPTY_STR.

    * In KeyedText.pm, reformatted all method/submethod signatures in the
    pod so they look more Perl 6 like; named args are now indicated with
    ":$foo" rather than "{ $foo }", and all args explicitly have trailing !
    to indicate mandatory or ? for optional.  However, the way you invoke
    them in code remains unchanged.

    * In KeyedText.pm, updated all documentation to replace 'submethod'
    with 'method', which is more accurate.

    * Upgraded both as_debug_string() methods to return results that are
    more self-explanitory and easier to read (and include linebreaks) when
    simply dumped to a terminal, alone or embedded in a larger message.

    * Gave both as_debug_string() methods the ": STRINGIFY" trait (provided
    by Class::Std), which means that Locale::KeyedText objects will now
    turn into something useful when simply used in a string context, such
    as with Perl's default exception handler that prints it like a string.

    * Updated both example MyApp.pl so their show_message() assume that
    Locale::KeyedText objects auto-stringify, rather than explicitly
    calling as_debug_string() on them.

    * Updated all files declaring Text Templates, mainly the examples and
    some POD, to rename the read-only %text_strings to %TEXT_STRINGS.

    * Added initial complement of 20 user text messages to the new en.pm,
    18 of which ('LKT_ARG_*') are generic (for use by any class) and relate
    to bad input arguments, and 2 of which are specific to
    Locale::KeyedText itself ('LKT_T_FAIL_GET_TMPL_TEXT',
    'LKT_T_FAIL_LOAD_TMPL_MOD').  Of the 18 generic messages, 9 are
    currently used by Locale::KeyedText itself (see next), and 9 are not.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to throw all of its own exceptions as specific
    Message objects, rather than generic text strings.  To implement this,
    added 3 private (enforced by Class::Std's ": PRIVATE" trait) methods to
    Message, and 5 to Translator, which conditionally compose and/or throw
    the new Message exceptions, and updated all of the other methods of
    those classes to invoke them.  These new methods have names like
    _die_with_msg() and _assert_arg_*().

    * Multiple updates in the TODO file.

2005-12-13

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.71.0/1.071000 (SVN r1145).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.71.0.

    * Reverted minimum Perl dependencies to 5.8.1 from 5.8.7, and added a
    Makefile.PL message about preferring the latest Perl version.

    * Added external dependency on Scalar::Util, and updated
    translate_message()'s argument validation to use its blessed() function
    plus the method form of UNIVERSAL's isa() rather than the latter's
    functional form.  The changed version should work more like Perl 6's
    does(), and should permit one to use a mock object that claims to be a
    Locale::KeyedText::Message instead of a genuine one.

    * Updated the examples to use a while-1 loop rather than an
    anon-block-redo loop.

    * Minor README update.

2005-11-24

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.70.0/1.070000 (SVN r1090).

    * Raised and multiplied the minor version number so that the current
    X.Y.Z formatted version numbers are backwards compatible with the older
    releases in X.0Y format, with respect to determing which version
    numbers are larger or smaller.  The new version 1.70.0 is equivalent to
    1.07 under the old format, in which the last release was 1.05.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.70.0.

    * This release is identical to release 1.6_5 except for the version
    change and a few minor documentation updates and fixes.

2005-11-18

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6_5/1.006_005 (SVN r1060).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6_5.

    * This release has only small documentation updates and serves partly
    to test CPAN's handling of a NAME split across multiple lines.

    * In KeyedText.pm, updated the NAME and DESCRIPTION, and fleshed out
    the SEE ALSO and ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.  With the latter two, all the
    details removed between releases 1.6.2 and 1.6_3 were restored.

    * Renamed the ReadMe file to README and updated it also.

2005-11-11

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6_4/1.006_004 (SVN r1049).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6_4.

    * This distribution now reqires Perl versions >= 5.8.7, up from 5.8.1.

    * Completed fundamental rewrite of KeyedText.pm, such that it can now
    do everything that the pre-rewrite release 1.6.2 could, and has been
    executed to confirm that it works.

    * Restored the 2 as_string() methods that release 1.6_3 removed, under
    the new names as_debug_string(); their output is now better formatted.

    * Reworked translate_message() to use a single for-loop rather than 2
    nested for-loops.

    * Split up the translate_message() method 6 ways, into itself, and the
    new get_set_member_combinations() method, and these Translator utility
    submethods: template_module_is_loaded(), load_template_module(),
    get_template_text_from_loaded_module(),
    interpolate_vars_into_template_text().  This split should make it a lot
    easier to test or extend a core functionality of Locale::KeyedText.

    * Fixed a bug in BUILD() that caused a thrown exception when new() was
    legitimately invoked without a 'msg_vars' argument.

    * Reformatted all package declarations from 'package Foo; {' to '{
    package Foo;', so the correct semantics occur where only declarations
    inside the braces belong to the package.

    * Changed how Text Templates work such that variable names to be
    interpolated must now appear inside "<>" instead of "{}".

    * Other small documentation updates.

    * Added new /examples subdirectory in this distribution, which contains
    2 example programs 'inverter1' and 'inverter2'.  The same code, sans
    bug fixes and minor changes, had previously comprised the 'EXAMPLE
    PROGRAM' POD sections of KeyedText.pm in release 1.6.2, that release
    1.6_3 removed.  The examples are all executed and are known to work.

    * Note that, while Locale::KeyedText can be proven to work by manually
    executing the example programs, the automated test suite in /t still
    does not yet execute anything; such a change is pending.

    * Removed several TODO items, which are now satisfied.

2005-10-27

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6_3/1.006_003 (SVN r996).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6_3.

    * This release exists only to test some large pending changes for this
    and other distributions against the CPAN infrastructure, to ensure it
    indexes properly and the documentation is extracted as expected.

    * The core modules (KeyedText.pm) have been rewritten from scratch,
    both code and documentation, though the new version was strongly
    influenced by the the previous release, and a lot of the documentation
    was copied over with few changes.  They are definitely incompatible
    with previous releases 1.6.2 and below.  A few more unstable releases
    may follow that are numbered 1.6_x, after which the 1.7.0 release will
    be next stable one, still incompatible with 1.6.2.  It is anticipated
    that all post-1.7.0 releases will be backwards compatible with 1.7.0.

    * "Locale::KeyedText" no longer has any functions and exists just as
    the namesake of this distribution; the new_message() and
    new_translator() wrapper functions are gone.  You now just use the
    previously-wrapped functions Locale::KeyedText::Message->new() and
    Locale::KeyedText::Translator->new() instead.

    * Both new() constructor functions now have named parameters instead of
    positional ones, which should make it easier to add functionality to
    Locale::KeyedText later if one wants to.  But all object methods still
    have positional parameters like before.

    * Changed what kinds of strings are valid to store in the Message Key,
    names of Message Variables, and elements of Set Names and Member Names;
    each can now be any defined and non-empty string.  Also, values of
    Message Variables can be anything at all including references to
    objects.  Also, the Translator constructor arguments must now always be
    array refs, even if either has just a single element.

    * All constructors and methods now throw exceptions on bad input,
    rather than returning undef.

    * Renamed all the accessor methods to be more terse, as follows:
    get_message_key() -> get_msg_key(), get_message_variable[|s]() ->
    get_msg_var[|s](), get_template_[set|member]_names() ->
    get_[set|member]_names().

    * Removed both as_string() methods; they will be replaced later.

    * Added new external dependencies on 'only', 'Readonly', Class::Std,
    Class::Std::Utils.

    * Locale::KeyedText is now implemented as inside-out objects, so the
    privacy of its attributes is now enforced.  Also, KeyedText.pm itself
    now has BUILD() methods internally instead of new() functions.

    * Removed the whole test suite but the compilation test; it will be
    replaced later.  As such, the new Locale::KeyedTest has not yet been
    proven to actually work.

    * Chopped out all the ReadMe file parts that were redundant with
    KeyedText.pm's own POD.  All that remains now is the PREFACE, KEEPING
    UP TO DATE, and SUPPORT sections.  More changes may be pending.

    * Rewrote the TODO file.  Most of its items will be addressed by 1.7.0.

2005-09-28

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6.2/1.006002 (SVN r878).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6.2.

    * From now on, any ordinary 'use [|only ]Foo' statements that appear
    within *.pm files will be located in different places than before; the
    'use' statements for modules that do not export anything, particularly
    object oriented modules, will appear near the top of the file, above
    all package declarations, but just below the use-pragma statements; the
    'use' statements for modules whose exported functions we are using will
    be placed just below the declarations of each package in which the
    relevant exported functions are used.

    * Removed any line-trailing whitespace from all distribution files.

    * Reformatted all code by swapping various string quoting delimiters.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to replace all of its 'unless' conditionals with
    equivalent 'if' conditionals.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to rename all of its 'foreach' loops to 'for'.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to move its 2 for-loop labels upwards to their
    own lines, and likewise with 2 switch statement labels.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to reformat all 5 regular expressions so that
    they use the /x flag.

    * Reformatted all code to change any "if( ... ) {" to "if (...) {".

    * Added named constant $EMPTY_STR to KeyedText.pm.

    * In KeyedText.pm, renamed 2 code labels from LOOP to INPUT_LINE.

    * Reformatted all code so that any uses of the named unary operators
    [defined|ref] no longer have parenthesis around their argument.

    * In KeyedText.pm, split up 3 multi-statement lines so each statement
    is on its own line.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to replace 8 "<condition> or return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <complement-condition>;".

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to replace 4 "<condition> [and|or] [next|last]
    ...;" with "[next|last] ... if ..." like with 'return'.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to rearrange 7 conditional 'die' statements so
    they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Reformatted all code, in KeyedText.pm and t_LKT_Util.pm, so that any
    uses of the built-in operators or functions named [bless|chomp|join] no
    longer have parenthesis around their argument lists; either the parens
    were just removed, or they were moved to surround both the
    operator/function name and its arguments.

    * Reformatted all code so that every occurance of the string
    concatenation operator (.) has a space between the operator and each of
    its 2 arguments, rather than their all being in contact.  Also
    reformatted any lines that are split on this operator so the operator
    appears at the start of the second line, rather than the end of the
    first line.

    * Reformatted all of the code comments at the top of KeyedText.pm,
    where its object property names, and constant values, are declared,
    so that all comment lines don't exceed the 75 character line length.

    * In KeyedText.pm and t_LKT_Util.pm, reformatted (3,1) cascading
    ternary statements into aligned columns.

    * In KeyedText.pm split up every remaining code, code comment, and POD
    line that exceeded 75 characters, so they now all fit in that space,
    with the sole exception being the example code in the 2 'EXAMPLE
    PROGRAM' POD sections, which are still too wide.

    * Other miscellaneous code line alignments and splitting.

2005-09-12

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6.1/1.006001 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    1.04 thru 1.6.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

2005-09-08

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6.0/1.006000 (SVN r787).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.6.0.

    * From now on, if the minimum Perl version that this distribution
    depends on (currently 5.008001) comes bundled with a satisfactory
    version of a module that we have a dependency on, then we will no
    longer specify any version number when referring to said module.  An
    example of such is Test::More.

    * Added a new main title to this Changes file that matches the ReadMe
    file.

    * Rewrote the documentation section KEEPING UP TO DATE in the ReadMe
    file.

    * Minor KeyedText.pm documentation update so that any Perl subs which
    were referred to as "function/method" etc are now simply "function".

    * Updated the DESCRIPTION paragraph of KeyedText.pm that refers to how
    easy to install the module is; it now says the module has few external
    dependencies, rather than specifying zero.

    * Converted every distribution file to use indentations composed of
    space characters (4 spaces per indentation level) rather than tab
    characters.

    * Updated all files containing POD (*.pm, *.pod) to re-order some POD
    sections.  Now all of the POD is after all of the code, rather than
    that being mostly true but for a bit of POD before most of the code.
    The 'NAME' POD has been moved to just above the 'SYNOPSIS'. The
    'DEPENDENCIES' has been moved to just above the 'SEE ALSO'.  Any 'BUGS'
    and 'CAVEATS' have been moved to just below the 'SEE ALSO'.  The
    'COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE' has been moved to the very end of the file,
    except that any 'CREDITS' have been moved below that.  Also updated the
    ReadMe file to move the 'CREDITS' below the 'COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE'.
    There were zero changes to the content of any POD sections, and no new
    POD sections were added or existing ones removed, except for those
    explicitly listed below.

    * Updated all files containing POD:  Deleted the 'SYNTAX' section,
    whose value was dubious, from any files that had one.  Renamed
    'COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE' to 'LICENCE AND COPYRIGHT', and added a new
    'AUTHOR' section just above it.  Renamed 'CREDITS' to
    'ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS' in any files that had one.  COPYRIGHT and CREDITS
    were likewise renamed in the ReadMe file.

    * Updated the POD in all *.pm files:  Added a new 'VERSION' section,
    which appears just below the 'NAME'.  Added a new 'INCOMPATIBILITIES'
    section, which appears just below 'DEPENDENCIES'.  Renamed and/or
    merged any 'BUGS' and 'CAVEATS' sections into a single 'BUGS AND
    LIMITATIONS' section, and added that section to any files lacking its
    predecessors.  Rewrote the 'DEPENDENCIES' into a new
    paragraph-resembling format that specifies where each dependency is,
    such as bundled with perl, or bundled with the current distribution, or
    available on CPAN; also rewrote the ReadMe file version.

    * Updated all *.pm files to add a new external dependency on the
    'version' module, which has core-like functionality but isn't yet
    bundled with Perl; all 'our $VERSION' declarations were changed to
    qv-wrapped three-part format from floating point format; likewise,
    updated the *_00_Compile.t file to use 'version', and also changed the
    tests for expected module versions to be performed by is() rather than
    cmp_ok().

    * This is the first release of this distribution and its modules for
    which they had 3-part version numbers, rather than floating point
    version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

2005-06-14

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.05/1.050000.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.05.

    * This release contains a large batch of changes that were done
    simultaneously in the Perl 5 and Perl 6 versions of Locale::KeyedText;
    the Perl 6 versions can be seen on CPAN in the upcoming
    Perl6-Pugs-6.2.8 distribution beneath its /ext/Locale-KeyedText
    directory.

    * Updated all files in this distribution that display the physical
    address of the Free Software Foundation, Inc. so it uses their current
    address of "51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA"
    rather than their previous address of "59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
    Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA"; this affects every COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE
    statement in the core files and the 'ReadMe' file, plus any 'GPL' or
    'LGPL' license file.

    * Updated the INSTALL file so that it is more generic, and all of my
    distributions now use an identical copy of it.

    * Updated the main heading in the ReadMe file to state the
    distribution's name rather than a terse description of it.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to remove superfluous input restrictions that
    were present for all Message and Translator properties.  Now each
    element of said properties can be any defined value, including the
    empty string, and there are no invalid characters.  Previously you
    could mainly just use alphanumeric characters for them.  Updated
    methods Message.new() and Translator.new() to implement the change, and
    also updated the POD sections that overview the Message and Translator
    classes concerning this.

    * Added a restriction to the Translator class such that each of its
    array properties must have at least 1 element (which can be the empty
    string); previously, zero elements were allowed.  Corresponding POD
    update in the Translator class overview.

    * Removed the translate_message() code comment about an assumption of
    properties being previously cleaned.  Added an item in the TODO file
    concerning a future policy change being required to handle literal '{'
    and '}' in Message Variable Names.

    * Removed the BUGS documentation in KeyedText.pm; it simply referred to
    the quality of the French user-text examples in the POD.

    * A few other minor POD bug fixes or updates.

    * In t_LKT_Util.pm, reorganized the serialize() function's dispatch order.

    * Large updates to the 2 LKT_[10_Msg|20_Trn]Props.t files where about
    half of the tests were added and/or removed, and some otherwise edited.
    In summary, there are a lot fewer tests that dealt with expected
    failure cases and some extra that deal with expected success cases.
    LKT_10_MsgProps.t now has 5 fewer tests, LKT_20_TrnProps.t has the same
    number, and LKT_30_TrnMsg.t now has 1 fewer.

    * Zero changes were made to the 4 t_LKT_[A|B]_L_[Eng|Fre].pm files.

    * This is the last release of this distribution and its modules for
    which they had floating point version numbers, rather than 3-part
    version numbers.

2005-05-13

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.04.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.04.

    * Updated every instance of the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE documentation in
    this distribution to correct the declared date range in which the core
    Locale::KeyedText files were created.  The new dates are 2003 thru 2005,
    which is when I actually committed documentation describing or code
    implementing what became the Locale::KeyedText core.  The old dates were
    1999 thru 2005, which goes back to the time that I started conceiving a
    larger project which the aforementioned module started out being related
    to; however, those earlier years did not contain any work on what
    specifically became the aforementioned module, so they are now excluded.

    * Updated every instance of the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE documentation in
    this distribution so that you may now choose between licensing it under
    the LGPL version 2.1 or any later LGPL version, rather than only under
    version 2.1.

    * Renamed the "LICENSE" file to "LGPL", and correspondingly updated all
    references to it in this distribution, most of them being in COPYRIGHT
    AND LICENSE statements.  This change was made to reduce user confusion
    in situations where files from this distribution may be aggregated with
    other files that have different licenses; the old name was too generic.

    * This release saw a large reorganization of the test suite.  The file
    t/Locale_KeyedText.t was split-up into these 5 parts (numbers in parens
    are the portion of the original 102 numbered tests that each part got):
    t/lib/t_LKT_Util.pm (zero), t/LKT_00_Compile.t (4), t/LKT_10_MsgProps.t
    (29), t/LKT_20_TrnProps.t (34), t/LKT_30_TrnMsg.t (35).  The test
    utility module t_LKT_Util.pm contains the message() and serialize()
    functions used by most of the other test scripts; the message()
    function also received a minor update such that its output is prefixed
    with '#' rather than '--', like Test::More does for comments.  Also
    renamed the 4 t_Locale_KeyedText_*.pm files to t_LKT_*.pm.

    * Updated the new test script t/LKT_00_Compile.t to add 9 brand new
    numbered tests for a total of 13; 6 of these 13 use Test::More's
    use_ok() function to cleanly test that the 1 core module and 5 test
    modules will load without errors; 1 of these tests, with cmp_ok(), that
    the 1 core module is of the correct version; 6 of these test, with
    can_ok(), that the 5 test modules declare the required functions.  This
    new script runs prior to all of the others.  Before this change, the
    original test script would simply die without any ok/not ok.

    * Renamed this file to 'Changes' from 'ChangeLog'; the new name is more
    descriptive to its free-form structure, and more consistent with CPAN
    (which uses both names but 'Changes' seems to be more common these
    days).  Also truncated this Changes file to remove all detail entries
    for releases v1.00 thru v1.03; in their place was added a change
    summary for releases v0.01 thru v1.03 that mainly just said what the
    names and versions of all the predecessor distributions and modules are.

2005-04-03

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.03.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.03.

    * Added new external dependency on Test::More v0.47 (bundled with Perl
    5.8.x); this distribution's test suite has been re-factored to use it
    rather than rolling its own equivalent functionality, which is more in
    line with CPAN best practices.  The new dependency does not extend to
    this distribution's core modules (everything in /lib), which do not use it.

    * Updated every 'use' statement in this distribution so that the module
    version is formatted as a number rather than a string; this fixes a
    problem where Perl was not asserting that the installed modules were
    new enough.

    * In order to help ease the transition to Perl 6, updated every in-code
    function and method which made direct references to @_ elements so that
    they explicitly declare argument variables instead with "my (...) =
    @_;"; moreover, any functions that don't use their invocant use "undef"
    for it in the above list.  These 6 KeyedText.pm code routines were
    affected: new_message(), new_translator(),
    Message.get_message_[key|variables](),
    Translator.get_template_[set|member]_names().  Also, every in-code (test
    suite) or in-POD (KeyedText.pm) Template class declaration was affected.

    * Multiple KeyedText.pm POD updates: 1. Wrote a brand new and much
    shorter SYNOPSIS, which should be much easier to learn quickly than the
    old one; 2. Renamed the old SYNOPSIS to EXAMPLE PROGRAM WITH ENTIRELY
    SEPARATED TEMPLATE MODULE FILES and moved it further down; 3. Wrote a
    brand new and much more accessible DESCRIPTION that should be much more
    suited to explaining the benefits and purpose of the module; 4. Renamed
    the old DESCRIPTION to HOW IT WORKS, moved it further down, and edited
    it a bit more; 5. Renamed AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES to
    ALTERNATE EXAMPLE PROGRAM WITH MOSTLY INTEGRATED TEMPLATE MODULES; 6.
    Demoted all the =head2 in the 2 EXAMPLE sections to ordinary one-line
    paragraphs and reduced whitespace.

    * Added a dated credit notice to Stevan Little in the ReadMe and
    KeyedText.pm; also copied an older credit notice to Jason Martin from
    the ReadMe to KeyedText.pm, adding dates; now credits are in both
    files.  In KeyedText.pm, these live in a new POD section called CREDITS.

    * Stripped this ChangeLog of release entries that were specific to its
    separately distributed Perl 6 version (in Perl6-Pugs), dated 2005-03-07
    thru 2005-03-13; those details will appear in the ChangeLog of a
    separate distribution of my own that contains just my Perl 6 modules.

    * NOTICE: This release v1.03 is the last one to contain detailed
    ChangeLog entries for releases v1.00 thru v1.03; release v1.04 will
    truncate the ChangeLog so it only shows details for v1.04 and later.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    SQL-Routine/Rosetta developer release #2.

2005-03-13

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.02.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.02.

    * This release primarily fixes bugs or makes code style improvements in
    this current Perl 5 version that were simultaneously performed on the
    brand new Perl 6 version in time for its Pugs v6.0.11 release.

    * Corrected a few spelling mistakes in the KeyedText.pm documentation.

    * Corrected a couple bugs in Locale_KeyedText.t: 1. The last 3 tests
    contained the wrong text in their output strings, suggesting that the
    last 4 all did the same thing. 2. Removed the vis() function, which was
    never used.

    * In order to help ease the transition to Perl 6, updated every in-code
    (in the test suite) or in-POD (in KeyedText.pm) Template class
    declaration to make all user text message strings bound in
    non-interpolating single quotes rather than interpolating double-quotes.
    The reason is because these text strings frequently use literal braces
    ({}) and Perl 6 would have incorrectly interpreted those as containing
    embedded Perl code to execute and interpolate the result value of.

    * Following a suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l, replaced the
    input checking negative assertions in Message.new() and
    Translator.new() with positive assertions that do the same thing; for
    example, rather than testing the input for being either an empty string
    or containing bad characters, it tests that input consists entirely of
    one or more good character; the new versions are much more concise and
    easier to understand.

    * Following a style suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l,
    updated every occurance of a "return" statement in the distribution to
    remove the parenthesis around its value list, since it is a an operator
    rather than a function; this also makes my code more consistent since I
    never used parens for the likes of "sort" or "keys" or "next" or
    "last".  Also updated every "return" to not explicitly return undefs
    (that's what "return" does by default), and also to not return a
    generic truth value ("1") when any caller would ignore it.

    * Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to use sub-headings "[|Non-]
    Core Modules" rather than "[|Non]standard Modules".

    * Updated the TODO file re supporting plain-text Template files.

2004-12-15

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01.

    * No further changes to distribution besides the version numbers.

2004-12-14

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01_2.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_2.

    * Updated the SYNOPSIS and AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES
    documentation in KeyedText.pm to add the character accents to the
    French language examples.  Those accents should have been there all
    along, but I didn't use them before v1.01 because ASCII didn't support
    them.  Also updated the BUGS documentation to remove the comment about
    missing accents.

    * Fixed a minor AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES code bug.

2004-12-13

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01_1.

    * This distribution now requires Perl 5.008001 or higher; it was 5.006.

    * All files in this distribution are now officially UTF-8 encoded,
    though they continue to have no BOM, and they still have Unix
    line-breaks.  Any files that contain code now have the "use utf8"
    pragma.  Any files that contain POD now have "=encoding utf8" as the
    first POD command paragraph.

    * All distro files that contain code, whether *.[pm|pl|PL|t], now begin
    with "#!perl" on their first line, and the second line contains "use
    5.008001; use utf8; use strict; use warnings;"; all other code and POD
    is below those. Within the *.pm files, the "package ... $VERSION ..."
    now appears above all of the POD; also, the NAME and DEPENDENCIES POD
    now have nothing between them.  Within the *.t files, there is no
    longer any BEGIN/END $loaded test, so the test count has been
    decremented by one.

    * Updated any SEE ALSO module references to be L<>.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_1.

    * Fixed a minor SYNOPSIS code bug in KeyedText.pm.

2004-09-23

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.00.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.00.

    * I hereby assert that Locale::KeyedText is complete, tested, and ready
    to be used in production environments.  No further updates are planned
    during the short term except in response to user requests.  Any future
    releases should be fully backwards-compatible with this release.

    * Any other changes to this distribution since v0.07, aside from the
    version change and the truncation of this ChangeLog file, follow below.

    * In KeyedText.pm, minor updates to the DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO docs.

    * Updated the TODO file.

    * This is the first release of this module following its official
    registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

    * This is the Locale-KeyedText-1.00 file manifest:

2004-08-31

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.07.

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v0.07.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm to use the modern syntax "our $VERSION = ..."
    instead of "use vars qw($VERSION); $VERSION = ...".

    * Moved this distribution's t_*.pm files from the /lib directory to a
    new /t/lib directory, so that they don't pollute the user's install
    directories, and so the distribution is better organized on the whole.
    Added a "use lib 't/lib';" to Locale_KeyedText.t in order to make the
    move work.  No changes to the tests themselves.  Updated the MANIFEST.

    * This is the last release of this module prior to its official
    registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

2004-08-05

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.06.

    * This is a small code bug fix release.  No POD or API changes were made.

    * Updated all distribution code that makes use of UNIVERSAL::isa() to
    test for valid objects so that it no longer incorrectly "passes"
    literal strings whose string values match the class names of valid
    objects.  For each test, "UNIVERSAL::isa($obj,'<class-name>')" was
    replaced with "ref($obj) and UNIVERSAL::isa($obj,'<class-name>')".
    Before the fixes, code that UNIVERSAL::isa() was supposed to guard
    would eventually die with the standard Perl error "Can't use string
    ('<class-name>') as a HASH ref", rather than elegantly dealing with the
    bad input value.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm (now v0.06) to fix one UNIVERSAL::isa()
    occurance in Translator.translate_message().  Also added 1 test in
    Locale_KeyedText.t to confirm that the bug was fixed.

    * Note that KeyedText 0.05 would die on (fail) 1 of the current 103 tests.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-SyntaxModel developer release #1.

2004-07-26

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.05.

    * This is a feature addition release; it is completely backwards
    compatible.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm (now v0.05) to add a new feature to
    Translator.translate_message() so that it first tests to see if a
    TEMPLATE class package is already loaded before trying to load it with
    "require". As a result of this change, Locale::KeyedText should now
    work for situations where you want to embed Template class package
    declarations in your standard code files, rather than in separate files
    of their own.  Also added new POD section AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED
    TEMPLATE FILES.  Thanks to Jason Martin (jhmartin@toger.us) for
    suggesting the new feature.  Also added 4 more tests to
    Locale_KeyedText.t, for a total of 102.

2004-06-26

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.04.

    * This is a small code bug fix release.  No POD or API changes were made.

    * Updated KeyedText.pm (now v0.04) to fix Message.as_string() and
    Translator.translate_message() so that each outputs interpolated
    message key values of zero as '0' and not ''.  Also updated 4 tests in
    Locale_KeyedText.t to confirm that the bugs were fixed.

    * Note that KeyedText 0.03 would fail 2 of the current 98 tests.

2004-03-05

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.03.

    * This is a small but incompatible maintenance release.  Or more
    specifically, it is only incompatible if your use of it involves
    reading the package names, such as with "UNIVERSAL::isa" (and the tests
    do); if you don't do that, then it is backwards compatible.

    * Updated lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm (now v0.03) to reorganize and more
    properly document its component class/package set.
    Locale::KeyedText::_::Message was renamed to Locale::KeyedText::Message
    and Locale::KeyedText::_::Translator was renamed to
    Locale::KeyedText::Translator.  The stateless new_message() and
    new_translator() functions were each moved into the packages of the
    objects that they create, and each was renamed to new(), and each now
    uses its first argument as the package name to bless into as is usual
    with Perl classes, and unlike the hard-coded bless it had before; two
    new functions having the old names now exist in their place and simply
    call the moved functions, so you can still invoke them like you did
    before.

    * Added new POD documentation section CLASSES IN THIS MODULE to
    KeyedText.pm which outlines the reality of the multiple package/classes
    in the single module, and their relation.  It also says that you should
    never make your own modules with any of the same package or module names.

    * The multiple package declarations in KeyedText.pm are no longer
    obfuscated (split over 2 lines each) to prevent PAUSE from indexing them.

    * Updated t/Locale_KeyedText.t so the correct class names are tested for.

    * No other files were changed.

2004-01-18

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.02.

    * This is a small bug fix release.

    * Added 2 more tests to Locale_KeyedText.t (for 98 total) that check
    for correct behaviour when Message Variables are given undefined hash
    values; the tests would produce warnings when run against release 0.01.

    * Made a couple small code updates to Locale::KeyedText, and
    incremented its version from 0.01 to 0.02.  Updated the methods
    Message->as_string() and Translator->translate_message() to substitute
    "" for any undefined Message variable values when building their output
    strings; now the 2 new tests will not throw warnings.

    * Fixed a few small mistakes in, and made small changes to,
    Locale::KeyedText's POD.  SYNOPSIS had bug fixes.  DESCRIPTION and SEE
    ALSO had some small additions.  Other areas had indenting fixes.

2004-01-15

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.01.

    * This is the initial release of Locale::KeyedText.  The module is
    feature complete and has complete POD documentation and a complete test
    suite.  The module is officially in beta development status, but should
    move quickly to Released status once it starts getting used in
    production.  The module is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License Version 2.1.

    * This distribution is the first one that I am creating with
    MakeMaker's "make dist" command; previously I used "tar -cz ..." to
    make distros.

    * This is the first release of any distribution to contain
    Locale::KeyedText.  This is the first release of any distribution for
    which some of the existing work that became the Locale-KeyedText
    distribution was in the form of executable code, and not just design
    documentation.

    * This is the Locale-KeyedText-0.01 file manifest:

    * Began active code development on the proposed Locale::KeyedText
    module.

    * Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2003-06-03

    * Rosetta Release 0.11 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution where the proposal documentation for
    Locale::KeyedText uses that name for it; it was renamed from
    Rosetta::Locale.

2003-05-28

    * Rosetta Release 0.10 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed
    module that became Locale::KeyedText was given the name
    Rosetta::Locale.

2003-03-04

    * Rosetta Release 0.05 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
    Locale-KeyedText distribution, specifically in the STRUCTURE and BRIEF
    MODULE LIST portions of the documentation file Rosetta::Framework.  It
    described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate
    human-readable messages from code, intending that each user language
    can have their own separate human text file.  The proposed core module
    name is Rosetta::Locale.

    * Given that I started publishing details about what became
    Locale::KeyedText here, 2003 is the start of my declared copyright date
    range for Locale::KeyedText.
